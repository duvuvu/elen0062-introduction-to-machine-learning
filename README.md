## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the projectS of the ELEN0062 course.

## Project 1
In this first project, we will get accustomed with some classical machine learning algorithms and concepts, such as under and overfitting. For each algorithm, we are asked to deliver a separate Python script.

Grade: 18.55/20

## Project 2
The goal of this second assignment is to help us better understand the important notions of bias and variance. The first part is purely theoretical, while the second part requires to perform some experiments with Scikit-learn.

Grade: 18.05/20

## Project 3
Human activity recognition is an important field, with applications like rehabilitation, illness detection, and healthy lifestyle help. This is heavily used in smart watches, for example.

In this project, we will explore this challenge using measurements from different subjects equipped with 31 different sensors, and performing an activity among 14.

**Goal**: Using machine learning, predict the activity being performed from the 31 time series corresponding to each sensor.
